# B2B API Usage Guide

Welcome, business partners! This guide explains how to securely and efficiently consume the Lyric Project REST API for B2B integrations.

---

## ü§ù What is B2B API Access?
B2B API access allows your business systems to interact directly with our platform ‚Äî automate user management, song ingestion, artist bio submission, and more.

---

## üîí Authentication
- Most endpoints require an `x-auth-token` (JWT) for secure access.
- Obtain a token by logging in via `/api/login`.
- Example:
  ```sh
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"admin@email.com","password":"yourpass"}' https://popular-mite-shree2604-bfb782a1.koyeb.app/api/login
  # Response: { "authToken": "..." }
  ```
- Use this token in the `x-auth-token` header for all subsequent requests.
