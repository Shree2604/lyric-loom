# Lyric Project API Documentation

Welcome to the Lyric Project API! This API is designed for both B2B (external partners) and B2C (your frontend app) use cases. It exposes RESTful endpoints for user, song, and artist bio management, and is fully documented using the OpenAPI/Swagger standard.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview
- **Purpose:** Provide a robust, secure, and well-documented API for managing users, songs, and artist bios for the Lyric platform.
- **Audience:** B2C (your React frontend) and B2B (external partners, integrations).

## üèÅ Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the backend server:**
   ```sh
   node Server.js
   ```
3. **Access API documentation:**
   - Open [https://popular-mite-shree2604-bfb782a1.koyeb.app/api-docs](https://popular-mite-shree2604-bfb782a1.koyeb.app/api-docs) in your browser for Swagger UI (interactive docs).

## üîí Authentication
- Most endpoints require an `x-auth-token` header (JWT) for authentication.
- Obtain a token by logging in via `/api/login`.
- Example:
  ```sh
  curl -H "x-auth-token: <TOKEN>" https://popular-mite-shree2604-bfb782a1.koyeb.app/api/users
  ```
